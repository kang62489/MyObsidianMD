## Notes
The average dimensions of varicosities (axon terminals)

Abstract Y_01
ChAT$^+$ varicosities (terminals) were relatively small, averaging 0.6 μm in diameter, 1.6 μm$^2$  in surface, and 0.12 μm$^3$ in volume. 

Low portion of ChAT$^+$ varicosities exhibits a synaptic membrane differentiation.

Abstract R_01
Synaptic membrane differentiation的特徵
These  synaptic junctions were usually single, symmetrical (>99%), and occupied a small portion of the surface of varicosities (<3%).

P2, Y_02
It is only in the last decade that ACh neurons could be reliably identified owing to the development of specific monoclonal antibodies against the biosynthetic enzyme of ACh, now termed choline acetyltransferase (ChAT; Crawford et al., 1982; Eckenstein and Thoenen, 1982; Lvey et al., 1983)
Refereces support the importance of ChAT labeling ChI.

#### Key Takeaways from Figures 6–18:
- **Varicosity Structure**: Varicosities are irregular in shape, often containing small synaptic vesicles and mitochondria.
- **Synaptic vs. Nonjunctional**: Most varicosities are nonjunctional, but some form symmetrical synaptic contacts, primarily on dendritic branches.
- **Mitochondria Presence**: Mitochondria are frequently observed in varicosities, contributing to their size and shape.
- **Axonal Organization**: Varicosities can occur in pairs or clusters along the same axon, with both synaptic and nonjunctional varicosities present on a single fiber.
