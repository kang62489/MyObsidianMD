# Useful Information
Introduction R_01
ChIs can be identified by their electrophysiological characteristics (Goldberg & Wilson et al., 2017) and by immunoreactivity of their enzymatic profile (Mesulam et al., 1984).

Introduction Y_01
This led to the proposal that interneurons were the main intrinsic source of striatal ACh.

the main source of striatal ACh still is the spontaneously active ChIs (Kitai & Surmeier, 1993; Pisani et al., 2007; English et al., 2012; Goldberg et al., 2012).

Introduction B_01
Group I (M1, M3, M5) receptors are coupled to Gq/11 proteins via a subunits that activate protein kinase C (PKC) and phospholipase C (PLC) leading to the production of inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol that results in an increase in intracellular calcium.

Group II receptors are coupled to Gi/o proteins, inhibit adenyl cyclase (AC) activity and close voltage-activated calcium (Cav) CaV2 channels while opening inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir3) following GPCR activation (Caulfield, 1993; Nathanson, 2000; Eglen, 2006; Haga, 2013).

Characteristics of cholinergic interneurons > Electrophysiological > Y_04
The fact that the firing properties of TANs are similar to some GABAergic interneurons has created confusion in the proper neuronal differentiation (Berke, 2008; Beatty et al., 2012; Gonzales et al., 2013; Gonzales & Smith, 2015; Apicella, 2017).

	- Influence of cholinergic interneurons within striatal microcircuits

> In spite of their relative small number, ChIs within the striatal microcircuits form enmeshed axonal projections with an extensive neuromodulatory presynaptic and postsynaptic effect (Descarries et al., 1997; Descarries & Mechawar, 2000) and most likely, interact with all neuronal elements through synaptic and volume transmission (Threlfell & Cragg, 2011). The modulation of striatal microcircuits by ChIs is exemplified in studies involving neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter release (Figs 2 and 3).
