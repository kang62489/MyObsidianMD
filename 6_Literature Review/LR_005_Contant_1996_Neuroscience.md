## Notes
>[!cite] R_01 p1 introduction
> Light and electron microscope immunocytochemical studies carried out in rat and monkey have provided descriptions of ChAT-immunoreactive axon terminals (varicosities) in addition to cell bodied and dendrites of neostriatum.
The description which regards axon terminals equal to varicosities


> [!cite] The source of the estimation of the numbers of striatal cholinergic varicosities (Y_01 p.7 Discussion)
> As there are approximately $10^6$ neuronal cell bodies per rat neostriatum and the immunostained varicosities represent almost one-fifth (19.4%) of all neostriatal axon terminals, i.e.  ACh varicosities per $mm^3$ or $9\times10^9$ per neostriatum (45 $mm^3$), it may be infered that each ACh interneuron possesses an average of 500,000 axon varicosities.
The estimation of the numbers of varicosities of each striatal ChI.
