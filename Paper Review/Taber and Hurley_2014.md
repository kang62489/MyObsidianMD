> The concept of volume transmission as an important mode of chemical communication in the brain was introduced [1,3,17, 20] in the 1980s. New techniques (e.g., receptor autoradiography, immunohistochemistry) that allowed detailed mapping of the locations of neurotransmitters (NTs) and their receptors led to several experimental findings that were not compatible with a purely synaptic mode of operation.

! The concept of volume transmission came from the new technologies that allow researchers can observe neurotransmitters directly.
