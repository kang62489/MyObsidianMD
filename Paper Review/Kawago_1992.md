大多數ES evoked DA response模型假設每個電刺激的pulse會立即產生Dopamine release

Abstract
> Uptake is found to be described by a constant set of Michaelis-Menten kinetics at each location for concentrations of dopamine from 100 nM to 15 μ M

The concentration of dopamine released per stimulus pulse is found to be greatest at 
1. low frequency (≤ 10 Hz) with stimulus trains. 
2. single-pulse stimulations in nomifensine-treated animals.

If appreciable concentrations of dopamine exist only in synaptic regions, then dopamine acts as a classical transmitter. Alternatively, if dopamine released from one terminal reaches concentrations in the extrasynaptic region that are sufficiently high to activate receptors over a wide spatial range, it may act as a neuromodulator.
我們unit主要是研究dopamine在striatum大區域下的影響，也就是將其視為neuromodulator來看其在某些行為下調控的機制
