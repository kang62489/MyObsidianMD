	- The abstract well-explain the terminologies
		
		> Volume transmission (VT) is a widespread mode of intercellular communication that occurs in the extracellular fluid (ECF) and in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the brain with VT signals moving from source to target cells via energy gradients leading to diffusion and convection (flow). The VT channels are diffusely forming a plexus in the extracellular space, while in wiring transmission (WT) the channels (axons, terminals) are private.

		- Further questions:
			- Does ACh act like DA?
			- Does the link between the volume and synaptic transmission of ACh has any importance or significance?
