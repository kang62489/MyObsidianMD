What I've gained from this paper which will be described in the following paragraph are important to revise my thesis proposal.
## 1. The way of developing a scientific question
The starting point of developing a scientific question is to integrate those things which is known. As this paper demonstrated, the study is based on the chemical transmission of ACh which occurs in the neuromuscular junction. What they knew the diffusion of ACh is retarded by rapid binding to the receptor sites, especially in the absence of the esterase. Besides, NMJ model occurs in the peripheral neural system. Therefore, a scientific question naturally generated is what happen when chemical transmission occurs in the CNS? Regarding choosing DA as their target, my extrapolating reasons will be discussed later.

Let's go back to the scientific question of my thesis proposal. "*The overarching question in the proposed thesis research is, what is the physical nature of  ACh signaling in the CNS? Specifically, what are the temporospatial dynamics of the ACh signal, as it spreads from its release sites to its receptors? Functionally, what is the significance of these dynamics for information transmission by ACh? The research will focus on ACh signaling by the cholinergic interneurons of the striatum (ChIs).*" The marked paragraph didn't link to something we know, namely the source of the proposed question is not clear. Therefore, as this reference did, I can probably add more lines describing some known facts that related to my scientific question. For example, the release and uptake of other neurotransmitter (e.g. glutamate, dopamine) in the rodent striatum. The significance of synaptic and volume transmission for glutamate and dopamine in striatum. Then, under similar thinking logic, I can designed my experimental plan following the concepts and methods that past researchers had done.

量測時間內的linearity不受影響意義:
1. 量的到信號就代表有efflux (out of synaptic structure) = 符合volume transmission定義
2. 能維持線性度所對應的時間(例如p1P的總週期)為不受ECS factors (e.g. antagonisms of drugs)影響的安全時間區間，且其時間長度也可用來評估是否足夠與intrasynaptic proteins完全反應/binding的參考(*通常是可以啦, 以paper提到的DA synapse為例, synaptic cleft ~ 15 nm, width ~ 300 nm)
