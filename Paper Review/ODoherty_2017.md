To explain the why we are interested in reward related learning

@Abstract
摘錄整理一些具有相關證據支持是與回饋相關行為有關的行為策略
包括**goal-directed or model-based system**與**habitual or model-free system**

本文用來評價證據是可以的支持某行為策略是存在且能控制回饋相關行為的標準:
最少可以證明是有存在部分神經組織對於上述系統功能運行是必要且關鍵的


?? goal-directed or model-based system
?? habitual or model-free system
?? adaptive and maladaptive behavioral outcomes

@Stimulus-Driven Control
Stimulus-driven control refers to a class of behaviors that are expressed in response to the onset of an **unanticipated** external stimulus.

@Stimulus-Driven Control
reflexes do not depend on synaptic plasticity

Pavlovian conditioning, also referred to as classical conditioning, is a means by which an organism can learn to make predictions about the subsequent onset of behaviorally significant events and leverage these predictions to initiate appropriate anticipatory behaviors (Pavlov 1927).

Pavlovian conditioning是一套可以讓生物體學習預測對某特定行為有意義的一連串事件發生, 再藉由此預測此類事件所產生的預期心理產生對應的特定行為

?為什麼要產生這樣類型的行為?
生物體在面對生存環境中的事件或挑戰時必須要做出適當的反應來獲取最大資源或降低傷害風險

@Stimulus-Driven Control
(In Pavlovian Conditioning)
The type of behavior emitted in response to the stimulus depends on the form of outcome the stimulus is paired with

P4
instrumental conditioning, a mechanism that allows them to learn to perform specific yet arbitrary behavioral responses (such as a lever press) in a specific context.
instrumentation conditioning 生物體用來提高主動獲得reward的意願的機制

增強式的刺激有助於學習主動式的行為，但代價是這類行為非出自於生物體本身的期待，而變為某種習慣。這樣的情形會失去原來Pavlovian conditioning的目的

p3
@Goal-Directed Control
Goal-directed control refers to a class of instrumental behaviors that appear to be motivated by and directed toward a specific outcome.

應該是由Pavlovian Conditioning派生出來的一個分支
實例: 訓練動物按拉桿來獲取食物

@Evidence for the Coexistence of Multiple Control Systems
For example, after animals were exposed to extensive training, they were found to persistently elicit responses associated with devalued outcomes (Dickinson et al. 1983).
說明兩種機制共存的可能性

Goal-directed 跟 Habitual 是對立的
