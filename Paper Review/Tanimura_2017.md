Check the fact
Striatum is the area containing highest levels of ACh in the brain

> The striatum has long been known to be a hotbed of cholinergic signaling as its expression of acetylcholine (ACh) and proteins necessary for its synthesis and degradation is among the highest in the brain;

The major source of striatal ACh

> Cholinergic interneurons (CINs) are the main source of ACh in the striatum [but see (Dautan, 2014)].

The dense axonal arborizations

> ChIs have a massive axonal arborization with as many as half a million vesicular release sites (Bolam et al., 1984; Contant et al., 1996), rivaling SNc DA axons.
