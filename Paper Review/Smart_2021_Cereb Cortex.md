Introduction (Y_01)
In preclinical models, ACh concentration has been found to be markedly higher in the striatum compared with the rest of the brain. Microdialysis and postmortem studies in rodents report ACh levels approximately 2â€“3 times higher in the caudate and putamen compared with extrastriatal regions including cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum (Cohen and Wurtman 1976; Modak et al. 1976; Hallak and Giacobini 1986; Ogane et al.
1990; Ichikawa et al. 2002; Wang et al. 2008), but this has never been confirmed in the living human brain.

- Description supporting the idea: The striatum are the area containing high level of ACh
- A good reason supporting measuring ACh in dorsal striatum
