## Notes
Abstract (Y_01)
The neostriatum is composed of caudate and putamen. The neostriatum is also the dorsal striatum

Abstract (R_01)
The cholinergic interneurons provide an ongoing acetylcholine (ACh) signal by firing action potentials tonically at about 5 Hz.

Abstract (B_01)
A high concentration of acetylcholinesterase in the striatum rapidly terminates the ACh signal, and thereby minimizes desensitization of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.
可以用來連接觀念 "Pause" of CIN neural activities may result in the decreasing of Acetylcholine concentration

Introduction (Y_02)
There are two major cholinergic subsystems within the telencephalon.
| Type        | Brain area          |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| projection  | cortex, hippocampus |
| interneuron | striatum            |
