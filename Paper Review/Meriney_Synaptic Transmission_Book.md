## Notes

P.352, Y_01, Termination of Action for Acetylcholine
Acetylcholinesterase is present in both the synaptic cleft and the cytoplasm of the axon terminal.
The following paragraph of this sentence didn't explain anything related to cytoplasm of axon terminal, so the concept may be wrong.

Cellular, Synaptic and Network Effects of Acetylcholine in the Neocortex
Acetylcholine can be released from vesicles into the synaptic cleft at synapses with a typical synaptic organization, as is the case at neuromuscular synapses described in Chapter 8. However, in the central nervous system, acetylcholine can be released both at typical synapses and also from varicosities (swellings) on axons (see Fig. 16.9)
