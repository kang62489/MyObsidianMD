Introduction Y_01
HCN channels conduct $K^+$ and $Na^+$ ions at a ration of 3:1 to 5:1. They are activated by hyperpolarization of membrane voltage to -50 mV or below, and conduct the hyperpolarization-activated current, termed $I_f$ in heart and $I_h$ in neurons (Brown et al., 1979; Difrancesco, 1993; Ludwig et al., 1998; Santoro et al., 1998). [cAMP](../Note/cAMP.md) can regulate the voltage-dependent activation of HCN channels in a subtype-specific manner, with HCN2 and HCN4 channels being highly susceptible to this molecule (He et al., 2014).  Downregulation of cAMP suppresses $I_h$ and shifts the HCN activation curve to lower voltage values (Biel et al., 2009). HCN channels play essential roles in the modulation of neuronal excitability, rhythmic neuronal activity, dendritic integration, and synaptic transmission, thus mediate multiple physiological functions.

HCN stands for "**H**yperpolarization-activated *C*yclic *N*eucleotid-gated"
HCN channel可被second messenger的cAMP啟動
cAMP與 M2/M4 muscarinic (GPCR receptor) receptor有關，因為M2/M4會抑制adenylyl cyclase使得cAMP的合成下降，進而抑制cAMP對HCN channel的調控，影響hyperpolarization-activated inward ion current與HCN本身的啟動電位.
