# Terminologies
- Resonators/Integrators types of neuron
	- is actually the type of injected currents (e.g. $I_{K},I_{Na}$)
Neurons can be classified as resonators or integrators depending on the forms of their subthreshold (Oscillating or not).
- reduced $I_{Na,P}+I_{K}$ - model (pronounce persistent sodium plus potassium model)
	- consist of a fast persistent $Na^+$ (amplifying) current and a slower $K^+$ (resonant) current.
	- equal to Morris and Lecar  model ($I_{Ca}+I_K$ - model)

- What is Hodgkin-Huxley model?
- Why sodium channel is a fast current?
- Why potassium channel is a slow current?
