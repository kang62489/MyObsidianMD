Check the fact
Striatum is the area containing high levels of ACh

> The striatum is a brain region containing high levels of acetylcholine (ACh), muscarinic receptors, and other ACh-related markers (Weiner et al., 1990; Hersch et al., 1994)

The population of CINs in striatum

> Despite their small numbers (1â€“3% of all striatal cells) and scattered distribution throughout the striatum, CINs have dense terminal fields that overlap those of dopaminergic projections coming from the substantia nigra pars compacta (Bolam et al., 1984)
