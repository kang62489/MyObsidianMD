行為實驗裡面 reward 影響 Cholinergic interneurons (CINs) firing action potentials ("pause")的實際例子

>Tonically active neurons of striatum (TANs = CINs) are known to respond to conditioned sensory stimuli that signal reward delivery and elicit behavioral reactions.

> When the monkey was trained to receive rewards **in relation to** a new conditioning stimulus, Tans were capable of switching their sensory response to the new stimulus.
