## Notes
recent work show spatiotemporal waves
- what is their recent work
1. acetylcholine release in mouse striatum also exhibits wave activity
2. the spatial scale of dopamine release is extended by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
3. single cholinergic interneurons can induce dopamine release

1+2+3 => hypothesis: local reciprocal interaction between cholinergic interneurons and dopamine axons suffices to drive endogenous traveling waves.

reaction-diffusion model

What is the "coupling" of acetylcholine and dopamine wave?
What does "local modulation of DA release" mean?
	DA release modulated by the nicotinic receptors (activated by ACh) on the DA terminals (axon)
the traveling wave of DA are generated locally in the striatum

1. ACh modulate local DA release by the nicotinic receptors on the DA terminals.
	- Striatal DA terminals (axons) express nicotinic (${\alpha_4}\beta_2$) receptors which can be activated by ACh released from striatal ChIs and can lead to the release of DA.
1. Wave-like dynamic was observed with GECIs in the neuropil of striatal ChIs in free moving mice.

Order of the article
1. The evidence for the existence of ACh waves in the striatum of mice.
2. The nAChRs extend the DA release range by several hundred micrometers.
3. activation of a single CIN suffices to induce local striatal DA release (time-locked to DA signals).
4. A mathematical model based on the interaction between CIN and DA fibers that can
	1. Provide similar time correlations that are observed empirically
	2. Formation of spatial Turing patterns that manifest the interferences of ACh and DA concentrations

activity within cholinergic neuropil is highly synchronized across the striatum

The reaction-diffusion model demonstrated the rise of the endogenous traveling waves based on the morphological and the physiological properties of cholinergic interneurons and dopamine axons

The functional significance of these waves is suggested  by evidence that medial to lateral waves were associated with instrumental learning, while lateral to medial waves were associated with reward delivery during classical conditioning.

There is mounting evidence that DA release is locally modulated, independent of DA cell firing at the soma.
=> DA ramp is independent to DA cell firing activities.

The paper investigated the hypothesis that the traveling waves of DA are generated locally in the striatum.
- DA neurons projected to striatum.
- DA ramps are independent to DA firing activities
- DA release (ramps) is/are generated due to local modulations

Bootstrapping demonstrated that the motion of the peak activity of the ACh signal is inconsistent with random spatial activations 35(Fig. 1e).
- I don't understand what does this mean

Synchronous activation of CINs can activate nAChRs on DA axons to drive DA release.
- The reason using field electric stimulation

a non-linear coupled reaction-diffusion system that can give rise to travelling waves.

AIRD system and Turing pattern
Self-activation and long range inhibition

Know coupling between CINs and DA axons:


assumptions:
- CINS activate nAChR@DA axons ----> DA release increased ----> DA inhibit ACh release by activating D2R on CINs
- The activation of nAChR has an inverted-U shaped dependence on [ACh] (fast kinetics)
- Both DA and ACh axonal arbors can be represented by "spatially extend variables"
	- what is spatially extend variables?
- The spread of activity is governed the cable properties of the axons
- CINs are self exciting by receiving inhibition from GABA interneurons that flip the inverted-U shaped nonlinearity of nAChR activation into an inverted-N shaped dependence of CIN activation on [ACh]
- The 1–10 μM range of [ACh] is hypothesized to be the physiological range (the range of [ACh] leads to a reduction of activation).
