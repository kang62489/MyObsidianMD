TANs

>Tonically active neurons (TANs) are so-called because they exhibit tonic firing activity (5 ~ 10Hz) (Tan and Bullock, 2008; Schulz and Reynolds, 2013). TANs receive glutamatergic inputs from the cortex and thalamus (Ding et al., 2010; Yager et al., 2015; Kosillo et al., 2016). These excitatory inputs convey sensory information during a salient event or the presentation of a reward
(Cragg, 2006; Schultz, 2016).

The major types of striatal neurons

> The neural populations within the striatum consist of GABAergic
medium spiny neurons (MSNs), cholinergic interneurons, and GABAergic interneurons (Kita, 1993; Koos and Tepper, 1999; Tepper et al., 2010; Dautan et al., 2014; Yager et al., 2015).
