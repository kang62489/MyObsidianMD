Look for spatial analysis/simulation of Acetylcholine release

### Abstract
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The cholinergic interneurons of the striatum account for a small fraction of all striatal cell types but due to their extensive axonal arborization give the striatum the highest content of acetylcholine of almost any nucleus in the brain.

? Highest content of acetylcholine caused by extensive arborization


A **mathematical model** is applied in the review

These considerations suggest that acetylcholine signaling by cholinergic interneurons is consistent with **point-to-point transmission** within a steep concentration gradient, marked by transient peaks of acetylcholine concentration adjacent to release sites, with potential for faithful transmission of spike timing, both bursts and pauses, to the postsynaptic cell.

? Point-to-point = synaptic transmission

Axonal varicosity
> Axonal varicosities are enlarged, heterogeneous structures along axonal shafts, profoundly affecting axonal conduction and synaptic transmission.

### Introduction 3. Striatal Cholinergic Transmission
Quantifying the dynamics of this concentration distribution requires estimates
of the amount of ACh released per spike from the release site, the spatial spread, and the time course of clearance.
