The population of CINs in striatum

> Cholinergic interneurons (CINs) are critical regulators of striatal activity despite constituting a small percentage (1â€“2%) of somata within the striatum. This is because of their highly ramified morphology that enables a single neuron to release acetylcholine across a large volume (Tanimura et al., 2018).
