## Notes
Checked 440 synaptic terminals (同時包含有label<5-hydroxydopamine>跟沒label的), identified by the presence of a population of vesicles.

Terminals are identified by the presence of a population of vesicles.

Categories of synaptic profiles:
1. (Abstract Y_01) One category contain **small** rounded or slightly pleomorphic vesicles and consisted of a sample of 375 endings,  53 of which exhibited light to heavy label inside synaptic vesicles. Forming asymmetric synaptic contact with the head of dendritic spines.
2. (Abstract R_01) A second category of 40 terminals, 3 of which were lightly labeled, contained **large** rounded or slightly pleomorphic vesicles and made predominantly symmetric contacts with the shafts of dendritic spines or spine-free portions of dendritic membrane.
3. (Abstract B_01) A third category of 25 terminals, 3 of which were labeled, contained small flattened vesicles, and these endings also invariably made synaptic contact, mostly onto spine-free dendritic membrane, and were characterized by symmetric membrane thickenings at the point of apposition.
