# Observed Phenomena/Anomalies
- The temporal changes of striatal Dopamine (DA) release induced by electric stimulation showed **overshoot** *(the concentration of released Dopamine kept increasing even the stimulation was stopped)* and **hang-up** *(the Dopamine concentration measured after the electric stimulation and the extracellular clearance still remain at an elevated level instead of returning to the baseline)*
- The described phenomena (overshoot, hang-up) didn't show up in collected dLight 2.1 (a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor for detecting Dopamine) signals.

# Summary
- The major idea of the project is to verify the **restricted diffuse model** of DA by fitting our Fast scan voltammertry (FSCV) data.
- Methylphenidate (MPD) and Raclopride (RPD) are applied in the experiments to amplify the effect of overshoot and hang-up.
