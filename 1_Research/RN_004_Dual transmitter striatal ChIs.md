Description: A survey investigates whether cholinergic interneurons can release neurotransmitters other than Acetylcholine.
---
# Trigger Scenario
While making the slides for Mtg_Lab_20250312. At [page 2](../../3_Meeting/Mtg_LAB_20250312/Mtg_LAB_20250312.md#^7b649b), I want to say "cholinergic interneurons primarily release ACh". However, it is known that some neurons have ability to release other neurotransmitters. Therefore, I made this survey.

# Survey
## Terminology
1. GAD
	- **GAD** stands for **Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase**, an enzyme that plays a critical role in the synthesis of the inhibitory neurotransmitter **GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid)**. Like the character of ChAT (choline acetyltransferase) to the acetylcholine.
2. VGAT
	- VGAT stands for **Vesicular GABA Transporter**. It is a protein responsible for the transport of the inhibitory neurotransmitter **GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid)** into synaptic vesicles within neurons.
3. Lhx6 and Lhx7

| **Feature**            | **Lhx6**                                                         | **Lhx7**                                        |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Role**       | Specifies GABAergic interneurons                                 | Specifies cholinergic interneurons              |
| **Expression**         | Expressed in GABAergic neurons (and some dual-transmitter CGINs) | Expressed in cholinergic neurons                |
| **Developmental Role** | Guides migration and maturation of GABAergic neurons             | Maintains cholinergic identity in adult neurons |
| **Marker For**         | GABAergic interneurons                                           | Cholinergic interneurons                        |
## 1. From the paper published by Lozovaya et al 
[crossRef:: c_01 p1 Abstract, Lozovaya, 2018_Nat Commun, @Line 10] 
The paper reports that half striatal cholinergic interneurons are dual transmitter cholinergic and GABAergic interneurons (CGINs) expressing ChAT, GAD65, Lhx6, and Lhx7 mRNAs, labeled with GAD and VGAT

| **Key Result**                                                                 | **Position in Document**                                                          | **Figure Number** | **Method Used**                                                                |
