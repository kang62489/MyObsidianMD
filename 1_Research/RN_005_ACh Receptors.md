# Classification
The classification of nicotinic and muscarinic ACh receptors is based on the sensitivity of these receptors to the toxic plant alkaloid and muscarine.

# Muscarinic Receptors
Muscarinic ACh receptors are highly expressed in corpus striatum and various  other forebrain region, where they activate inward rectifier $K^{+}$ channels or $Ca^{2+}$ -activated $K^{+}$ channels, there by exerting an inhibitory influence on dopamine mediated motor effect.

## M1
Muscarinic M1 receptors are found throughout the brain, with the highest concentrations in cortical  regions, including the hippocampus.
[crossRef:: kp01 p.2 Mucarinic Receptors, Scarr, 2011_CNS Neurosci Ther, @Line 22]

Cortical M1 receptors are primarily located post-synaptically; there they are predominantly associated with excitatory synapses but are also found at cholinergic synapses
[crossRef:: kp02 p.2 Mucarinic Receptors, Scarr, 2011_CNS Neurosci Ther, @Line 25]

## M2
M2 receptors are highly expressed in the nucleus basalis and occipital cortex, being present at lower levels in the hippocampus, caudate putamen and other cortical region
[crossRef:: kp03 p.2 Mucarinic Receptors, Scarr, 2011_CNS Neurosci Ther, @Line 29]

M2 receptors are also present in a subset of glutamatergic synapses and GABAergic interneurons; nearly a third of cortical GABAergic neurons express M2 receptors
[crossRef:: kp04 p.2 Mucarinic Receptors, Scarr, 2011_CNS Neurosci Ther, @Line 32]

M2 receptors acts as autoreceptor on ChI and mostly located extrasynaptically suggesting  a role in volume transmission (Bernard et al., 1998).

## M3
M3 receptors show a similar distribution to M1 receptors but with a much lower level of expression. Like M1 receptors. M3 receptors are also reported to be present in cortical pyramidal cells and glial cells in the rat.

## Summary of Muscarinic Receptors

### The receptors of acetylcholine

Acetylcholine (ACh) is the neurotransmitter that cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) release to transmit information through the extra-synaptic space to the other neurons. Its spatial distribution and temporal change could be critical indicators for understanding neural functions. The synaptic activities of released ACh, i.e., the quantity of extra-synaptic ACh, are mainly mediated by the receptors and the hydrolysis. Therefore, in this little journal, I am going to summarize the properties of muscarinic receptors, a class of ACh receptors, from literature, especially for those express at striatal area.

Based on the sensitivity of ACh receptors to toxic plant alkaloids, they are fundamentally categorized into two classes, nicotinic and muscarinic receptors. For studying the ACh neurotransmission in the central nervous system (CNS), muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChRs) are important since they are largely expressed in the corpus striatum. Besides, these metabotropic mAChRs involve most of the ACh effects in the brain. Muscarinic receptors are also a kind of G-protein coupled receptors, meaning when the ligand (ACh) binds to these receptors, their structures undergo conformation change and then permit the intracellular G-protein to bind to their cytoplasmic domain. In contrast, nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) belong to ligand-gated ion channels whose conformation change of protein structure generates a pore that allows certain ion flow in or out. Because of involving the second messenger system, mAChRs react slower than the nAChRs.

### Subtypes of muscarinic receptors and their expression

mAChRs are currently known to have five subtypes (M1 – M5). As mentioned in previous paragraph, the activation of muscarinic receptors triggers the intracellular signaling by second messenger cascades. Each subtype of receptors is selectively coupled to distinct G proteins. M1, M3 and M5 coupling to Gαq/11 subunits; M2 and M4 couple to Gαi/o subunits. In addition to their canonical signaling pathway, cell expression systems have revealed their ability to activate multiple signal transduction pathway on the basis of cell types. It is also this characteristic that makes them easily become complicated to determine their physiological properties. In CNS, the five mAChRs subtypes are distributed overlappingly across different brain regions. M1, M3, and M4 receptors were found in cortex and basal ganglia. M2 could be in nucleus accumbens (NAc), hippocampus (HPC), and basal ganglia. M5 is present in HPC, substantia nigra (SN), and ventral tegmental area (VTA). Striatum is the major input major input nucleus of basal ganglia. The target of my study, striatal ChIs mainly expresses M2 and M4 AChRs.

### Physiological functions of striatal muscarinic receptors

Determining the physiological functions of each subtype of muscarinic receptors was restricted to their overlapped distribution and low ligand selectivity. Studies showed that classical pharmacological tools (muscarinic agonist and antagonist) have led to conflicting results. However, genetically engineered knock-out (KO) mice provide a new way to specifically study the physiology effects by removing one or more subtypes of mAChRs from certain brain tissue. For example, Zhang et al’s study based on M2-/-, M4-/-, and M2-M4 double KO mice suggests that these receptors mediate suppression of dopamine transmission in striatum.
