## Voltammetry
- Measure current @ different applied potentials
- measure redox potentials rather $E^0$
- "Formal potential",  $E^{0'}$, potential under known conditions
	- Most under the condition: $\frac{[red]}{[ox]}=1$
- Measure adsorbed species
- Probe mechanism of $e^-$ transfer
- Typical setup - three electrode setup
	- reference electrode
		- for potential meter
		- Usually filling with AgCl solution and Ag wire
			- SCE (standard calomel electrode, $Hg_2Cl_2/Hg$)
	- working electrode
		- Connected to potential meter and power supply
		- Made of Pt disc/Au/Glassy Carbonate
	- count electrode
		- connected to the negative port of power supply
		- Made of Pt wire or mesh

- Conventions for reading voltammogram
	- American conventions
		- x+ negative potential x- positive potential
		- y+ positive current cathodic; y- negative current anodic
	- IUPAC
		- x+ positive potential x- negative potential
		- y+ positive current anodic; y- negative current cathodic


- Solution
	- Analyte 1 mM
	- Eletrolyte 0.1 mM (not reactive, just make the solution conductive) 

## Cyclic Voltammetry
- Scan voltages (applied potentials) back and forth at linear rates.
![Nernst Equation](Nernst%20Equation.md)
The equation only holds @ surface of electrode

Analytes have to pass "double layer" to reach the charged electrode surfaces.

$E_{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{E_{p.a.}+E_{p.c.}}{2} \approx E^{0'}$
$\Delta E = E_{p.a.}-E_{p.c.}=\frac{0.059}{n}V@25^\circ C$  (under ideal situation)
