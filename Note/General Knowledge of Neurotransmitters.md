Small molecule neurotransmitters 
- Acetylcholine
	- Acetylcholine
- Amino acids
	- Glutamate
	- Aspartate
	- GABA
	- Glycine
- Purines
	- ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate)
- Biogenic Amines (= Monoamines)
	- Def of monoamine: monoamine neurotransmitters are neurotransmitters and neuromodulators that contain **one amino group connected to an aromatic ring by a two-carbon chain (such as -CH2-CH2-)**
	- Def of catecholamine: a catecholamine (/ˌkætəˈkoʊləmiːn/; abbreviated CA) is a monoamine neurotransmitter, an organic compound that has a catechol (benzene with two hydroxyl side groups next to each other) and a side-chain amine.
	- Catecholamines:
		- Dopamine
		- Norepinephrine
		- Epinephrine
	- Indoleamine
		- Serotonin
	- Imidazoleamine
		- Histamine
