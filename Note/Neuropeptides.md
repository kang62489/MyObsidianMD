The term neurotransmitter is applied traditionally to a substance that is released by one neuron and acts on an adjacent neuron in a stimulatory or inhibitory fashion. The effect is usually rapid, brief, and confined to a small area of the neuronal surface. In contrast, a hormone is a substance that is released into the bloodstream and usually travels to a distant site to act over seconds, minutes, or hours to produce its effect over a large area of the cell or over many cells. Neuropeptides can act in either fashion. For example, the neuropeptide vasopressin, produced by the neurons of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, is released into the bloodstream and has a hormonal action on the collecting ducts in the kidney. Vasopressin is also released within the central nervous system (CNS), where it acts as a neurotransmitter. Similarly, the neuropeptide substance P acts as a neurotransmitter in primary sensory neurons that convey pain signals and as a neurohormone in the hypothalamus.

List of neuropeptides:
1.  Substance P: Substance P is a neuropeptide that is involved in the transmission of pain signals in the body.
2.  Oxytocin: Oxytocin is a neuropeptide that is involved in a range of social and reproductive behaviors, such as bonding, trust, and childbirth.   
3.  Vasopressin: Vasopressin is a neuropeptide that is involved in regulating water balance in the body and can also play a role in social behaviors.
4.  Enkephalins: Enkephalins are neuropeptides that are involved in pain relief and can act as natural painkillers.    
5.  Cholecystokinin (CCK): CCK is a neuropeptide that is involved in regulating digestion and appetite, as well as anxiety and mood.    
6.  Neuropeptide Y (NPY): NPY is a neuropeptide that is involved in regulating appetite and energy balance, as well as stress and anxiety.    
7.  Galanin: Galanin is a neuropeptide that is involved in regulating a range of physiological processes, including pain, appetite, and mood.

Release of neuropeptides requires high-frequency burst of action potentials for many seconds.
