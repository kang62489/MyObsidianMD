FIGURE 1 | Overview of the basal forebrain(BF) cholinergic pathway. The BF cholinergic system of the Sprague-Dawley rats includes the medial septum(MS), vertical limbs of the diagonal band of Broca (vDB), nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM), and substantia innominate (SI). The vDB and NBM have diffuse projections to all parts of the neocortex and to basolateral amygdala and olfactory bulb (these latter two are not shown here). The MS and vDB project to hippocampus. Besides, the brainstem cholinergic system projects to the thalamus and hypothalamus but also to the BF region. This system includes the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT) and laterodorsal pontine tegmentum (LDT).
