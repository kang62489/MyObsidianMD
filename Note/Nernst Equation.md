$E(t) = E^0 - \frac{RT}{nF}\ln\frac{[Reduction]}{[Oxidation]}$

$E_{A} = \frac{RT}{Z_{A}F}\ln\frac{[A]_{out}}{[A]_{in}} = 2.303\frac{RT}{Z_{A}F}\log\frac{[A]_{out}}{[A]_{in}}$
where R is the gas constant ($8.314 V C K^{-1} mol^{-1}$), T is the absolute temperature (T = 273° + °C), $z_A$ is the charge of ion A, F is Faraday’s constant ($9.648 \times 10^4 C mol^{-1}$), and $[A]_o$ and $[A]_i$ are the concentrations of ion A outside the cell and inside the cell, respectively. At 20 °C (“room temperature”), $2.303(RT/z_AF)log10\{[A]_o/[A]_i\} = 58 mV log10\{[A]o/[A]i\}$ for a univalent ion.
