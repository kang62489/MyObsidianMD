## Notes
等同GTP-binding proteins
GTP (Guanosine Triphosphate)

Two general types of GTP:
- Heterotrimeric G-proteins: consist of three distinct subunit (α, β, γ)
- Monomeric G-proteins (small G-proteins)

α subunit binds to guanine nucleotide, either GTP or GDP.
GCPR的工作原理
1. Ligand Binding
2. GDP release from  alpha subunit. The G-protein dissociated from the receptor and break into alpha and beta-gamma subunit, both can be effector. the alpha unit binds to GTP as effector molecules such as adenylyl cyclase 或phospholipase c.

G-protein也可以bind and activate ion channels
如 mAChR (beta-gamma g protein)可以打開鉀離子通道，造成去極化降低firing rate
alpha subunit則可以快速關閉鈣離子或鈉離子通道，造成類似的抑制效果。
