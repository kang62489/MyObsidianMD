Action potential = impulse = spike
- Depolarizing phase
	- Threshold (-45 mV)
	- Overshoot (0 - peak)
- Peak
- Repolarizing Phase
	- hyperpolarizing afterpotential/undershoot (resting potential to negative peak)

The frequency is related to the voltage of electric stimulation
In nerve system, the duration of action potential is brief so that it can encoded various firing patterns.

Resting potential
- Start from potassium ion ($[K^+]_i > [K^+]_o$)
- [[Nernst Equation]]: $E_K = 60log(\frac{[K^+]_o}{[K^+]_i})$
- ($[Na^+]_o > [Na^+]_i$)
- GHK equation:  $V_m = 60log(\frac{[K^+]_o+\alpha[Na^+]_o}{[K^+]_i+\alpha[Na^+]_i}); \alpha = P_{Na^+}/P_{K^+}$
- Depolarization activate some voltage dependent channels that increase the permeability of Na
- Tetrodotoxin (TTX, sodium voltage dependent channel blocker)
- Tetraethylammonium (TEA, potassium voltage dependent channel blocker)
