Ch1, Appendix I
Basically talking about how cell membrane change according to external current source. The membrane of a excitable cell is just a simple RC circuit with build in battery (resting potential).

Ch1, Appendix II
The time constants of the brain
- Myelinated fiber : 50 $\mu$s
- non-myelinated fiber: few ms

>[!warning] Left to check, p32-p33
> However, even though a lot of current may flow through cells in the earliest stage of a pulse, this will not cause much change in the transmembrane potential of the cell (see Section II, Cases 4 and 5).

p.32
times of pulses << RC : a lot of current will flow through the cell
times of pulses >> RC: DC case holds.

p.33
The length constant of most (nerve) fibers is between 75 $\mu m$ to 500 $\mu m$. When considering current flow over distances shorter than this, not much current flows in cells; therefore, over short distances the resistivity of brain is greater than over longer distances.
> [!question] This is not intuitive
> Usually resistivity shall be proportional to the wire (path) length.

p.34
The electrical impedance of brain may be referred to Bennett, 1969.
