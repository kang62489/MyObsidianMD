- Axon terminal = Varicosities

Synaptic transmission核心: 出現synaptic 結構，主要判斷方式以觀察有無出現對位的dendrite spine或shaft以及synaptic specialization
Volume transmission概念: 並無具體定義，主要描述皆為屬擴散的型態(大範圍無特定場域，速度較慢)，有團隊定義為Neurotransmitter 擴散超過synaptic cleft的距離

> [!question]
Volume transmission =?= non-synaptic transmission

> [!answer]
> Yes. In Abudukeyoumu's review they mentioned that M2 autoreceptor located mostly extrasynaptically. And this is the reason that it is regarded to be related to volume transmission

> [!question]  Are synapses the only sites that neurons contact with other?

> A: No.
> Chemical singling is not, however, limited to synapses. [crossRef:: c_01 p.145 Strategies of Molecular Signaling, Purves, Neuroscience_6ed, @Line 18]
> Using the sentence - "chemical signaling in nerve systems" may be more precise.
