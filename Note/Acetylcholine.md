	- play important roles in memory, arousal, and attention

## Synthesis of ACh
ACh is synthesized from choline and acetyl CoA within the axon terminals of cholinergic neurons (Meriney and Fanselow, 2019). Choline is an essential nutrient which can be found in blood or in the form of phosphatidylcholine. Acetyl CoA is generated in mitochondria. ^1c96ab
