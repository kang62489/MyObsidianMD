# Basic Information
## Composition
- (Dorsal) Striatum = neostriatum (Ref :: Zhou_2002_J Neurobiol)
	- Caudate Nucleus
	- Putamen
- (Ventral) Striatum
	- Nucleus Accumbens
	- Olfactory tubercle

Neuron population
- Medium Spiny Neurons (MSNs): 95%
	- They are also called projection neurons.
		- @ (The MSNs express D1 receptors, can be mediated (excited) by DA) **direct pathway**, they project to globus pallidus internal capsule (GPi) and Substantia nigra pars reticulata (Most of the neurons that project out of the pars reticulata are inhibitory GABAergic neurons (i.e., these neurons release GABA) (GABA/SNr)
		- @ (The MSNs express D2 receptors, can be mediated (inhibited) by DA) **indirect pathway**, they project to GP external capsule (GPe) and subthalamic nucleus (STN)
		- They are also project to thalamus and amygdala
	- Receiving Glutamate signals generated by the projection from cortex
	- ==(Ref :: Lim_2014_Front Synaptic Neurosci, P.1, p_01)==
	  Approximately 6% of MSNs in the dorsal striatum express both D1 and D2 receptors. These cells produce both glutamate and GABA, allowing them modulate the basal ganglia  connectivity bidirectionally. 
	- Receiving DA signals (by D1 and D2) generated by the projection from substantia nigra (SN) and ventral tegmental area (VTA).
- GABAergic interneurons: 4%
- Cholinergic interneuron: 1%  
	-  ==(Ref :: Lim_2014_Front Synaptic Neurosci, P.2, p_02)==
	  Although recent tract tracing and electron microscopy studies report cholinergic projections from the rostral pedunculopontine nucleus into the striatum (Dautan et al, 2014), it is generally accepted that ChIs are the main source of striatal ACh(WoolfandButcher,1981).


## The significance to basal ganglia
The striatum is the primary input-receiving nucleus of the [basal ganglia](Basal%20Ganglia.md), and the modulation of information flow through, The striatum is crucial to basal ganglia functions including motor control and reward-driven behaviors. Two key striatal neuromodulators are dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (ACh). Striatal ACh plays powerful roles not only in regulating excitability of striatal neurons, but also in directly regulating DA transmission
