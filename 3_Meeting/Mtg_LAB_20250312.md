# Feedbacks from people (who viewed the slides)
- Jeff 
	- He doesn't like the picture of analogy (Rakuten mobile phone signal coverage), so I removed.
	- He suggested to record extracellular field potentials and then align these signals to spontaneous ACh fluorescent responses. Maybe this will be better than forcing striatal cholinergic interneurons to fire by injecting currents.
- Jeet
	- The mechanic forces generated by puffing may also induce the ACh release.

# Notes of the slides
- p2
	- Title: My Research ^7b649b
	- **Cholinergic interneurons "primarily" release ACh
		- I did some survey to see if cholinergic interneurons might release other neurotransmitters. [Link](../../1_Research/RN_004_Dual%20transmitter%20striatal%20ChIs.md)
- p3
	- Title: Core Question
	- **The slide shows the reason of the investigation is to answer this question.
	- The (scientific/major) question which I'm the most interested in: ![](../../1_Research/RN_002_My%20Research.md#^7272e4)
	- **Why raise the core question?
		- Each ChI is like a group of base stations
		- Anatomically,
			- Striatal cholinergic interneurons are specifically located in the striatum.
			- Each ChI has highly ramified axons
			- Each ChI has approximately 500,000 varicosities [crossRef:: Y_01 p.7 Discussion, Contant,1996_Neuroscience, @Line 20]
				- Varicosities: swelling structures on axon which are potential release sites of ACh. They usually contain
					- Mitochondria [Synthesis of Acetyl CoA](../../Note/Acetylcholine.md#^1c96ab)
					- Vesicles of ACh
					- [crossRef:: figs 6-18 Results, Umbriaco, 1994_J Comp Neurol, @Line 21]
		- Besides,
			- ChIs can fire autonomously
			- ChIs have different firing patterns
		- We know that the release of neurotransmitters is basically controlled by action potentials. Therefore, it is nature to consider the firing patterns may encode the temporal and spatial distribution of ACh signals. If I can show that there is a connection between the firing patterns and ACh spatiotemporal distribution. I may be able to answer the question.
- p4 
	- The firing patterns of striatal cholinergic interneurons
	- [crossRef:: c_01 p.3 Spontaneous firing observed during whole-cell recording, Bennet and Wilson, 1999_J Neurosci, @Line 31]
	- **This is to show the spontaneous firing patterns of a striatal ChI in a slice of rat's brain.
	- By patch-clamp electric stimulation, I should be able to induce or mimic these firing patterns.
- p5
	- Title: The First Hypothesis**
	- My first hypothesis written in my project is
		- An action potential of a single ChI will cause an inhomogeneous distribution of ACh concentration with hotspots rather than homogenous distribution in striatal ECS. A subsidiary hypothesis is that variations in the patterns (regular, irregular and bursting) of firing will modify the characteristics of hotspots (e.g., range, peak and location).
	- **I think the things (experiments, studies) still fit the original hypothesis 1 (unchanged)
	- Why set this hypothesis?
		- I will probably break down it into two.
		- If a ChI can determine the ACh signals' spatiotemporal distribution, there must be some places which are unique → hotspots.
			- So my first aims are to find out these hotspots. How? There are several problems need to be solved in advanced.
				- **How to detect ACh?**
					- Something to provide high spatial and temporal resolution.
				- **How to generate ACh?**
					- Recognize cholinergic interneurons
					- Fire it!
- p6
	- Just the historical follow of my study
	- Approaches of detecting ACh and my first choice
	- Approaches of generating ACh and my first choice
- p7
	- Title: Tests of the Sensor (Tet-OFF_iAChSnFR)
	- To show the very first trial of using iAChSnFR to detect ACh release in the acute brain slices.
	- A part of the test for Gideon (iAChSnFR specificity)
- p8 - 9
	- Title: Tests of the Sensor (Tet-OFF_iAChSnFR)
	- Summary of the test for Gideon  (iAChSnFR specificity)
	- **Puffing is not a good approach for studies in brain slices
- p10 - 13
	- Title: Tests of DREADD (hM3D-mCherry) + iAChSnFR
	- A demonstrative picture of the overlapped IRDIC, mCherry with DREADD, and iAChSnFR imaging
	- To show the ACh responses I successfully measured before, but not sure what are they.
	- p13 is to show the $\Delta F/F_0$ of these signals and compare to the later analysis of spontaneous responses.
	- This may be an evidence show that excitatory DREADD (hM3D) was not work.
- p16
	- Title: Summary 2
	- **To explain why I now change to Patch-Clamp
- p17 - 21
	- Title: Tests of Patch-Clamp + iAChSnFR
	- To provide a quick glance of my Clampex protocol, ACh imaging results, and recorded electric signals (firing activities)
	- The program of analysis hasn't completed, so I could not provide too many details.
- p22 - 23
	- Title: Tests of Patch-Clamp + GACh 3.0
	- **To show the suspicious ACh responses reflected on GACh sensors. The kind of responses have not been found by iAChSnFR.
