## Future Plan
1. Complete thesis proposal (Writing)

Key
Applying current techniques (Genetic encoded tools, photometry, etc.) to answer the scientific questions.

Question
- How does striatal CINs react during and after external stimulus
	- Striatal CINs are widely regarded as the modulator/regulator of neural activities.
	- The input and output of CIN circuit
		- input: significances in psychology
		- output: the function of CINs


Goal
Quantifying ACh concentration (Especially temporal change)

Aim 1
Measure ACh concentration change in brain slices during excitation/inhibition
- To find a valid way (DREADDs) to control CINs' activity

Aim 2
Comparison of epifluorescence and fiber photometry
- To test and optimize the probing method (fiberoptic photometry/sensors) for monitoring CINs' activity

Aim3
Measure ACh concentration change in vivo
- Verify the psychological differences of goal/sign trackers by ACh signaling

2. Complete the report of the experiment (Chemogenetics/DREADDs)

## Feedback from PI
1. Finish the analysis before next experiment
