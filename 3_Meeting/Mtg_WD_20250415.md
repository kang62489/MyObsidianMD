Descriptions: A discussion of ACh signals acquired in GACh3.0 and hM4D(Gi)-mCherry expressed brain slices. Block-wised and Gaussian-Blurred results are presented and compared.

# Feedbacks from people (who viewed the slides)
Kang
- *Use Gaussian blur to deal with the images may be better (Smoother in space).*

# Notes of the slides
- p3 - 4
	- Title: [Before, After] flowing 100 uM J60
	- **To show that the spontaneous responses were significant reduced
- p5 - 8
	- Title: Trial of firing the patched cells during DREADD activation (SLICE_1, CELL_2)
	- **Forgot to collect the patch-clamp stimulation before the DREADD activation
	- **No ACh signals responded to the patch clamp stimulation at frame (#200 t=10s, #600 t=30s, #1000 t=50s)
- p9 - 12
	- Title: Trial of firing the patched cells <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">before</mark> DREADD activation (SLICE_2, CELL_1)
	- **Spontaneous and Triggered (by patch-clamp) ACh signals were observed.
- p13-16
	- Title: Trial of firing the patched cells <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">during</mark> DREADD activation (SLICE_2, CELL_1)
	- **Spontaneous ACh signals were inhibited. However, the stimulation triggered ACh signals are also inhibited.
		- The concentration of JHU37160 needs to be carefully checked. **Otherwise, the situation in SLICE 1, CELL2 (previous) may happened
- p25 - 28
	- Title: Trial of firing the patched cells during DREADD activation (SLICE_2, CELL_1)
	- **To show that ACh signals from GACh3.0 are able to response rapid and multiple stimulations (pulse train)
