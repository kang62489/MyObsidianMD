# Feedbacks from people (who viewed the slides)
Gideon
- Maybe redo the experiments with dopamine
- He will discuss with Jeff
Jeff
- Do the reanalysis first

# Notes of the slides
- p2 - 3
	- Title: Reviewers' Comments
	- **Important questions that in reviewer 3's comments
		- Spatial heterogeneity of ACh
		- ROI issues: sizes, locations
		- How neostigmine works on iAChSnFR
		- The reliability of the preprint of iAChSnFR
- p5
	- Title: Possible Explanations to the Questions
	- **Use the concept of SNR to answer the question of ROI sizes.
- p6 
	- Title: Possible Explanations to the Questions
	- **Test the responding speed of iAChSnFR by multiple ACh puffing
- p7
	- Title: Possible Explanations to the Questions
	- **Compare ACh puffing responses of slices bathed in recording ACSF solution with the presence of donepezil (<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">NEW!!</mark>)
		- iAChSnFR is not detecting donepezil or tacrine
- p8
	- Title: Known Puffing Issues
	- **Remind the known puffing issue, before repeat the puffing tests.
- p10-13
	- Title: Preliminary Tests
	- **Preliminary results of potential solution 1
		- Using minimum period of puffing
			- Show the a snapshot extracted from the manual
- p14
	- Title: Another Possible Solution
	- **Using syringe pump to see if we can provide smaller puffing pressure
		- recommended pressure: 20 - 30 mbar
		- applied pressures before: 4 psi = 280 mbar and 12 psi = 80 kPa = 840 mbar
		- 1 psi = 70 mbar = 6.89 kPa, 100 mbar = 75 mmHg,
	- Other things may be useful
		- **Move the pipette tip outside or far from FOV

## 2025-May-09
- Modify some titles of slides in the pptx file to fit the notes of slides in this markdown note.
- Modify the contents of this note to make it more concise.
- Correct the highlight locations so that the true important information (not the title of the slides) is marked.
