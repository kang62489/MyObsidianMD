# Feedbacks from people (who viewed the slides)
Gideon
- The reply in his e-mail
	- Yes, it looks good. Neostigmine plot has relatively no noise compared to the earlier one. But we need to check again from the reviewer comments to see if this is enough to answer. I may also discuss further with Jeff sometime this week
# Notes of the slides
- p11-12
	- Title:  Step 01 Preprocessing (Important)
	- **Remind people that the analysis is not based on the whole fields of each frame in a tiff file.
		- This is important because the results may vary depends on the size and location of ROIs chosen in the codes.
- p15
	- Title: Request from Jeff (Related to Step 02, Important!!)
		- **Explanation of the alignment (t=0 position) of time axis 
- p20
	- Title: Step 03 Temporal Analysis (Important!!)
	- **Double-check the calculation of $\Delta F/F_0$ and Z-scores.
		- How I chose $F_0$ to detrend and calculate ratios.
