# Description
This experiment is to test excitatory DREADD (hM3D) with GACh3.0 sensors. Mao-Ting and I wanted to know if JHU37160 is working or not. It should be a better designer drug compared to CNO because it is water soluble (No need to use DMSO). 
# Key Findings
1. The motion artifact of puffing is very strong, I can not really tell if the drug works or not.
2. The bleaching trend at start is very steep, pre-bleaching will solve the problem.
3. Spontaneous responses are observed with GACh3.0 sensors.
4. The serotype used for hM3D is AAV1, maybe need to change to AAV8 or AAV9. Besides, mCherry expression is also dim, I will consider change it to tdTomato.

# Data Summary
## 0. System

## 2. mCherry expression are bad
## 3. GACh3.0 show some fluctuation, but the bleaching trend at beginning are too large to see.
## 4. By quickly checking long puffing duration (50ms, 100ms) trials, we can found the dropping and rising frames are same to the duration. This means the responses are probably just motion artifact
50 ms -> 1 frame
100 ms -> 2 frames

## 5. There still some problems in synchronize LED and Camera.
Ext. Exp. Ctrl are bad. First frame over exposed and last frame delayed (half exposed). Some frames' edges are dark stripes.
