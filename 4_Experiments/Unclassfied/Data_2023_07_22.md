# Description
This is the second-try of imaging the expression of AAV1 packed iAChSnFR/GACh mixed with AAV1 packed cre-dependent (ChAT-cre) mCherry label. 

# Key Findings
1. The expressions of GACh and iAChSnFR are both find, but the mCherry was not great.
2. The sampling rate of imaging acquisition need to be increased. The bleaching trends in imaging data needs to be eliminated.
# Data Summary
## 0. System
- Gimli
- This is the last experiment which I've done on Gimli.
## 1. Animal Info
Animal ID: neoChAT-291
Owner: Kang
SEX: Female
DOB: 2023-01-19
DOD: 2023-07-22
DOI: 2023-06-23
Age: 26 weeks
Incubated: 4 weeks

## 2. The fluorescence intensities of mCherry labelled cells are weak, and SNR are also bad. It may due to the volume of injection was low.

- 2024_07_22-0013

## 3. Due to the low sampling rate (10 Hz) and strong bleaching, the dynamics of ACh are generally not prominent either with GACh or iAChSnFR.

- 2024_07_22-0010 (iAChSnFR at slice 3 right)
## 4. This time the GACh expression is stronger than iAChSnFR. The difference compared to previous result on (2023-06-13).
The difference may resulted from unfamiliar/unstable injection.
