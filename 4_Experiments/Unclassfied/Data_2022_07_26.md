# Description
This is a pclamp protocol pre-tests (one day ahead) of the demonstrative experiments in Jeff's courses.

# Key Findings

# Data Summary
## 0. System
- Frodo
## 1. Test sample
Probably model-cell (CV-01) was used.

## 2. Used PClamp Protocols:
- elect_1 (for measuring epsp/ipsp before and after hfs)
- elect_hfs (high frequency pulse train stimulation for inducing LTP)
- elect_hfs_depTest
