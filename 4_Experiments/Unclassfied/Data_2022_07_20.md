# Description
This is one of the demonstrative experiments in Jeff's courses (the first time). The primary goal is to show LTP/LTD of post-synaptic neurons.

# Key Findings

# Data Summary
## 0. System
- Frodo

## 1. Animal (no injection)
Animal ID: neoChAT-204
Owner: Kang
SEX: Female
DOB: 2023-04-19
DOD: 2022-07-20
Age: 13 weeks

## 2. The protocols used in the experiments were explained in "ExpNote_handwrittend.pdf"
### Used PClamp Protocols:
- IV-1 (I-V scanning)
- gapfree_5min
- elect_1 (for measuring epsp/ipsp before and after hfs)

## 3. Fixed the wrong recording conditions.
Part of recording files are mismatched to the logs in handwritten pdf file. I checked and corrected the descriptions in the ExpNote_20220720.xlsx file (on Aug 4, 2025).

## 4. The HFS should be done with the elect_hfs.pro
The 2022_07_20-0010 is the recording of hfs. However, it didn't use the elect_hfs.pro (checked by python program: check_protocol.py), instead it used elect_1.pro which is weird. I marked yellow in the recording excel sheet.
