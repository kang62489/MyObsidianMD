# Description
Since puffing to DREADD is not working. I decided to switch to patch-clamp method. On one hand it can specifically activated single ChI (patched), on the other hand it can also monitoring the vitality of the patched neurons. This is a practice with Jeff to get more familiar with this technique. The ChAT cells were labelled with mCherry. For the purpose of patch, non-tetracycline version of iAChSnFR is also applied
