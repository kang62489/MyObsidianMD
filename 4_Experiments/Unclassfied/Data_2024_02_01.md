# Description
The experiment was designed for looking for wave-like ACh transmission under 10X objective lens. The animal was injected with with 200 nl AAV1-ihSyn-tTA-sv40/TRE-iAChSnFR-minWPRE (089) at 2 sites
# Key Findings
1. The image sizes (each merged file: 2048x2048, 1200p ~ 1 TB) are extremely large which are hard to open.
2. The overall intensity and spontaneous responses of iAChSnFR are weaker than GACh3.0
