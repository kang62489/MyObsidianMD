# Description
- Retro-orbital injection & enhancer-specific expression 06
- This is to test if tdTomato has better brightness and labelling ability than mCherry (they both attached after DREADD-hM4D)
- The experiment also tried doing perforated patch clamp (pipette solution added with gramicidin)
# Key Findings
1. tdTomato is very good!!
2. perforated patch-clamp is very good!! (wait 15 min. after gigaseal)
# Data Summary

## 0. System
- Frodo

## 1. Animal
Animal ID: neoChAT-600
Owner: Kang
SEX: Female
DOB: 2025-01-27
DOD: 2025-07-24
DOI: 2025-06-15
Age: 25 weeks
Incubated: 5 weeks 

## 2. Used PClamp Protocols:
- kang_snapshot
- gapfree_5min
- kang_pulse_train
- kang_iv

## 3. ABF 0023 - tried to get hyperpolarization sags as a confirmation of patched cell is a cholinergic interneuron.


## 4. second patched ChI is a successful case of perforated patch-clamp
