# Description
This is one of the demonstrative experiments in Jeff's courses (the second time). The primary goal is to show LTP/LTD of post-synaptic neurons.

# Key Findings
1. Instead of LTP, LTD is observed.

# Data Summary
## 0. System
- Frodo

## 1. Animal (no injection)
Animal ID: R2-PV
Owner: Julie
SEX: Male
DOB: 2022-06-04
DOD: 2022-07-27
Age: 7 weeks

## 2. Used PClamp Protocols:
- IV-1 (I-V scanning)
- elect_1 (for measuring epsp/ipsp before and after hfs)
- elect_hfs (high frequency pulse train stimulation for inducing LTP)
- elect_hfs_depTest

## 3. Fixed the recording conditions.
