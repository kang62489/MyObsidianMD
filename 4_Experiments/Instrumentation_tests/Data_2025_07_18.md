# Description
The red fluorescence observed from Frodo/Pco.Panda is always weak. To check what happened, Jeff suggested me using fluorescent polystyrene (with specific ex/em wavelength ranges) to check.

The experiment on the date also included the estimation of puffing volumes.
# Key Findings
1. There was no problem with my system, the major problem is probably the expression of red sensors/labels were really bad.
# Data Summary
## 0. System
- PCO.Panda
