# Description
The folder contains the scale used for calibrating the actual lengths of objects observed by different microscope systems.
Scale bar calibration - BioRev
Scale bar calibration - PcoPanda

The experiment on the date also included the estimation of puffing volumes.
# Key Findings
BioRev
1. 4X = 0.3805 pixels/um
2. 10X = 0.9413 pixels/um
3. 20X = 1.870 pixels/um
4. 40X = 3 pixels/um

Pco.Panda (2048x2048)
1. 10X = 1.5467 pixels/um
2. 60X = 9.36 pixels/um

## 1. The old/bad BioRev scale images (acquired on 2023_10_01) are put in BioRev_old folder. All files are merged into 2024_05_09.

## 2. I forgot to memorize the magnification used for observing the droplets.

## 3. Adding files from 2025_03_ 23 (also changed this markdown's title)
