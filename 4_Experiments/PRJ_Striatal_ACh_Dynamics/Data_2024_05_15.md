# Description
This is the second times of ACh puffing to iAChSnFR experiments, used for developing imaging processing programs (MATLAB, python).
# Key Findings
1. Even with long pulse-width (1500ms) of puffing, I still need to use high concentration (millimolar level) of ACh to get significant ACh fluorescence change.
2. Strong bleaching trend is hard to removed by latest python programs.

# Data Summary
## 0. System
- Frodo

## 1. Animal
Animal ID: neoChAT-446
Owner: Kang
SEX: Male
DOB: 2024-01-26
DOD: 2024-05-15
DOI: 2024-04-26

## 2. High dose of ACh solution is necessary.
- from 0005 and 0014, we can only see huge ACh response from 5mM puffing (0014)

## 3. The bleaching trend at beginning is hard to remove even with my latest (2025 developed) imaging processing program

## 4. Contains 6-tile of 10X slice imaging sets (for montage)
