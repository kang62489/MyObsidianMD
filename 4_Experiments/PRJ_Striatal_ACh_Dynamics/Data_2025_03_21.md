# Description
This is an experiment mainly designed for repeating patch-clamp based recording and stimulation with GACh3.0 sensor. Meanwhile, I would like to double check again if iAChSnFR is really not suitable for this kind of setup.
# Key Findings
1. Huge background wave of ACh signals
2. Still have a strong difference at the gap (stop acquisition but not the LED)
3. Have many spontaneous responses, but they are also some kind of interferences.
# Data Summary

## 0. System
- Frodo
## 1. Animal (no injection)
Animal ID: neoChAT-581
Owner: Kang
SEX: Male
DOB: 2024-11-29
DOD: 2025-03-21
DOI: 2025-02-20
Age: 16 weeks
Incubated: 4 weeks 

## 2. Used PClamp Protocols:
- kang_long_stim
- kang_pulse_train

### Stop using Kitamura's stimulator because of some triggering issues

## 3. DIO-mCherry expression
- 60X TIFF 0004, 0006, 0024 bad
- 60X TIFF 0010, 0014 OK


## 4. ACh - ABF cross-checking (only this 5 OK)
- ABF 0006 TIFF 60X 0017
- ABF 0007 TIFF 60X 0018
- ABF 0008 TIFF 60X 0019
- ABF 0009 TIFF 60X 0020
- ABF 0010 TIFF 60X 0021

## 5. Forgot to log which side, probably only left side...
- The expression of GACh3.0 is more uniform, it doesn't like iAChSnFR tends to accumulated on soma (cell body).
