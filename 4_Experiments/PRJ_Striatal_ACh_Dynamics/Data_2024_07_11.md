# Description
This experiment is the third trial of using puffing and DREADD-hM3D (excitatory) with iAChSnFR sensors.
# Key Findings
1. The expression of AAV1-DIO-hM3D-mCherry is bad over 8 weeks incubation (checked both 60X and 10X). The presence of particle-like distribution in both green and red channels under 10X observation is the indicator.
