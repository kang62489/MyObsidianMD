# Description
- I considered if diluted GACh vector concentration (0.1X) may increase the expression of mCherry, so I did the test.
- This time I also use another mode (connected to BNC_2 on pco.panda) to trigger camera acquisitions which makes it almost continuous.
# Key Findings
1. No significant increase in mCherry expression, may need to increase mCherry's actual injection volume. or using tdTomato.
2. Now can see small spike-liked ACh signals with seamless recording.
3. The resting membrane potentials of patched ChIs were not calibrated well in VC (voltage clamp mode). Using perforated patch-clamp may reduce this kind of problem.
