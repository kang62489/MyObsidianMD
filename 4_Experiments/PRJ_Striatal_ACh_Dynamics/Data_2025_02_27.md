# Description
- Retry with better pclamp protocol to see if I can get better GACh3.0 signals.
# Key Findings
1. Confirmed that GACh3.0 is able to capture the ACh responses related given current stimulation.
2. Maybe to inhibit other ChIs and activate the one patched to really find out the related responses.
3. Need figure what are those big spontaneous ACh peaks and where are they come from.

# Data Summary

## 0. System
- Frodo

## 1. Animal (no injection)
Animal ID: neoChAT-550
Owner: Kang
SEX: Male
DOB: 2024-09-13
DOD: 2025-02-27
DOI: 2024-12-30
Age: 23 weeks
Incubated: 8 weeks 

## 2. Used PClamp Protocols:
- kang_long_stim
- kang_pulse_train
- kang_iv

### Stop using Kitamura's stimulator because of some triggering issues

## 3. DIO-mCherry expression
- 60X TIFF 0017, 0022, 0032 bad

## 4. IV (ABF 17, 23) don't contain hyperpolarization tests.


## 5. ACh - ABF cross-checking
- ABF 0009 TIFF 60X 0012
	- Find ACh signals responded to the stimulation induced action potential. However, they seems a little bit deviated, a bit of earlier than given currents. Further the first response of ACh is not prominent
- ABF 0010 TIFF 60X 0013
	- Not sure but see all three sections have a delayed ACh peaks seems delay more or less the same time.
	- The stimulation pattern is two pulses of 5Hz, not sure if this is the reason causing delay. (First release postponed to second one).
- ABF 0011 TIFF 60X 0014
	- Don't see any response related to 3 pulses 5Hz stimulations in the corresponding sections, maybe my guess is correct? The pulse train release is delayed.
	- However, I do see some responses appear in the wrong sections (probably because of delay effects)
- ABF 0012 TIFF 60X 0015
	- Similar results as previous one
- ABF 0017 TIFF 60X 0025
	- See precise responses to the induced one pulse stimulation at each sections.
	- The first frame problem (LED first trigger) need to be solved.
- ABF 0018 TIFF 60X 0026
	- Surprisingly see broaden responses happen exactly at frame 200, 600, 1000. Sees like the pulse train not making delay.
- ABF 0019 TIFF 60X 0027
	- Similar result as previous one.
- ABF 0002 TIFF 60X 0005
	- Super large ACh responses, but seems not directly related continuous and natural spontaneous firing.
- ABF 0003 TIFF 60X 0006
	- Can see a stimulation related responses showing near frame 600, however, the spontaneous responses are way more larger.
- ABF 0004 TIFF 60X 0007
	- similar to previous one
- ABF 0005 TIFF 60X 0006
	- spontaneous peaks are still strong, but the stimulation sees not working (can't find responses).
- ABF 0029 TIFF 60X 0039
	- Nice responses, but also contains strong spontaneous responses. Really need some inhibition to get clean signaling environment.

## 6. ABF 20, test the limitation in response to frequency (50Hz)
