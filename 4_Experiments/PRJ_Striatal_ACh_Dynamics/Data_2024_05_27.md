# Description
This experiment is the starting of using puffing and DREADD-hM3D (excitatory) with iAChSnFR sensors. Later on will change to inhibitory (hM4D).
# Key Findings
1. The expression of AAV1-DIO-hM3D-mCherry is surprisingly good (700 - 900 counts), maybe because of large volume injection (3 sites x 100 nl = 300 nl)

# Data Summary
## 0. System
- Frodo

## 1. Animal
Animal ID: neoChAT-449
Owner: Kang
SEX: Male
DOB: 2024-01-26
DOD: 2024-05-27

Age: 17 weeks
Incubated: 1 week

## 2. Some imaging sequences show ACh responses, however, I could not sure those are coming from activation of DREADD because I don't know how fast the drug works.
- I checked the responses in calibrated (with latest python program, 2025) 0005, 0008, 0012 imaging sequences, but the responses are still weak (maybe because of iAChSnFR)

## 3. Contains 6-tile of 10X slice imaging sets (for montage)
- Red images are in snapshot folder

## 4. There is no significant responses in groups (0017, 0018, 0019) with high dose of JHU37160
