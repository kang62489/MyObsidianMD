# Description
Practicing of patch-clamp ChIs labelled by mCherry. Try recording ACh responses by iAChSnFR (tTA version)

# Key Findings
1. The recording of firing and synchronization with imaging acquisition needed to be adjusted.

# Data Summary
## 0. System
- Frodo

## 1. Animal (no injection)
Animal ID: KC-nChAT-Hom-4
Owner: Kang
SEX: Male
DOB: 2024-07-21
DOD: 2024-10-03
DOI: 2024-09-20
Age: 10 weeks
Incubated: 1 weeks 

## 2. Used PClamp Protocols:
- IV-1
- gapfree-5min
- pulser

## 3. [ABF] 0020 - 0029
- A successfully patched cholinergic interneuron
- Spontaneous firing (gap-free recorded)

## 4. ACh imaging responses
- The length of frames (250p) is too short.
- Episodic recording with multi-sweeps (there will be gaps in between sweeps) is not good for imaging analysis. LED is turned off during gaps, this will cause bleaching trend in each short episode.

## 5. Forgot to acquire mCherry images.
