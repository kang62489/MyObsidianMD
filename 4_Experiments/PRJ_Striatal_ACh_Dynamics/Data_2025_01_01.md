# Description
Practicing of patch-clamp ChIs labelled by mCherry. Try recording ACh responses by iAChSnFR (tTA version)

# Key Findings
1. Although the spontaneous ACh responses is frequent and large, without proper inhibition, it's very hard to confirm if these fluctuations are related to certain ChI's spontaneously firing activities.
2. There are some weird stripy and dark patterns. Not sure if they were resulted from asynchronization of LED and camera triggering.
