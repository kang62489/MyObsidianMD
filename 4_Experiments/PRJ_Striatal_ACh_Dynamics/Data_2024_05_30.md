# Description
This experiment is the second trial of using puffing and DREADD-hM3D (excitatory) with iAChSnFR sensors.
# Key Findings
1. The expression of AAV1-DIO-hM3D-mCherry is surprisingly is also good  at both 60X and 10X (500- 600 counts/700 - 900 counts),  large volume injection (3 sites x 100 nl = 300 nl) probably is the reason.
2. No significant response at all, even with high does JHU37160 (10mM) and high pressure puffing (10psi). I think this may be the issue of the sensor of iAChSnFR, would be worth to retry with GACh3.0.
