# Description
Still using cre-dependent (DIO) mCherry to label ChIs, but switch ACh sensors from iAChSnFR to GACh3.0.

# Key Findings
1. The sharp and fast responses provided  by GACh3.0 may be able to fit the firing activities, compared to iAChSnFR
2. There are some problems in doing 3 sweeps in a trial, especially the LED and Camera synchronization issues (some files are failed).
3. It is worth to retry with better instrumentation settings.
# Data Summary
## 0. System
- Frodo

## 1. Animal (no injection)
Animal ID: neoChAT-549
Owner: Kang
SEX: Male
DOB: 2024-09-13
DOD: 2025-02-05
DOI: 2024-12-30
Age: 20 weeks
Incubated: 5 weeks 

## 2. Used PClamp Protocols:
- rep_1swps_1.5min (STIM_PROTOCOL 10)
- rep_6swps_3min (STIM_PROTOCOL 11)
- iv_1_kyc

## 3. DIO-mCherry expression
- 60X TIFF 0001, 0010 bad
- 60X TIFF 0024, 0039 OK
- 60X TIFF 0036 good
## 3. ACh - ABF cross-checking
- ABF 0029 TIFF 60X 0043 (Sharp spontaneous responses, but not responded to the given stimulation induced action potential)
- ABF 0030 TIFF 60X 0044 (Sharp spontaneous responses, but not responded to the given stimulation induced action potential)
- ABF 0031 TIFF 60X 0045 (Sharp spontaneous responses, but not responded to the given stimulation induced action potential)
- ABF 0021 TIFF 60X 0030 (frame 1 ~ 66 broken, and not responded to any given stimulation induced action potential)
- ABF 0022 TIFF 60X 0031 (Sharp spontaneous responses, but not responded to the given stimulation induced action potential)
- ABF 0025 TIFF 60X 0033 (broken again, seem like there are some problem in triggering LED and Camera again)
- ABF 0026 TIFF 60X 0034 (Sharp spontaneous responses, but not responded to the given stimulation induced action potential)
