# Description
This was the third time experiment of measuring two-site iAChSnFR injected animals (same group: 2024_02_01, 2024_02_15). The experiment uses long gaps (sampling rate: 1Hz) to avoid large imaging files. 
# Key Findings
1. Weird fluorescence recovery phenomenon showed after pre-bleaching iAChSnFR for 10 sec.
2. Weird long-term fluorescence recovery phenomenon showed.
