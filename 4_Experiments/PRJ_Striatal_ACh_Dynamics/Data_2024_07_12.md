# Description
This experiment is the last trial of using puffing and DREADD-hM3D (excitatory) with iAChSnFR sensors. Also checking an animal injected with iAChSnFR and iAChSnFR-Null at the same side (right). I want to know if null version really has no responses. However, the incubation is way too long (11 weeks).
# Key Findings
1. The expression of AAV1-DIO-hM3D-mCherry is still fine under the 7th weeks incubation (checked both 60X and 10X).
2. The second mouse injected with iAChSnFR and iAChSnFR is incubated too long (11 weeks) so the sensor died out.

## 2. DREADD-hM3D-mCherry expression (10X)
- [Left Side no injection] 0005, 0011, 0023 ()
- [Right Side] 0002 (bad expression)
- [Right Side] 0008, 0020, 0036, 0047 (good expression)

## 3. DREADD-hM3D-mCherry expression (60X)
- [Right Side] 0014, 0017, 0026, 0044, 0054, 0062, 0069, 0072 (all good)
- These well expressed neurons all have some particle-liked distributions within the cell bodies. My guess is they left after long incubation and then the cell body will no longer visible.

## 4. Puffing of JHU37160 (10X)
- [Right Side] 0038, 0039, 0041, 0049 (No response)
- [Right Side] 0040, 0050, 0051 (Strong motion artifacts)

## 5. Puffing of JHU37160 (60X)
- [Right Side] 0056, 0064, 0065, 0066, 0074, 0075 (No responses, and file sizes are too large to be opened from external hard drive)
- [Right Side] 0057, 0059 (small spontaneous responses + puffing artifacts)
