# MEMO (Before the experiment)
- Recording only 60X images
- Recording IR, Red, and Green channels for precise cell and pipette positions
- change protocol 1 with longer frames
- In protocol 2, hold currents at the firing states and than record the ACh images. Not just set one pulse in 1200 frames like before.
